<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a User Experience and User Interface Designer with a history in the software and gaming industry. I have done it all - from 3ds Max, Zbrush, Substance, Photoshop in the art domain, to Figma, Webflow in the User Experience design space. I have strong arts and design sense with a keen interest in technology, especially Computer Science. These varied interests have given me a drive to combine disparate areas of interest to better enhance experience of the designs I create. </p>
